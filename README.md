This database contains 34 attributes, 33 of which are linear valued and one of them isnominal.The differential diagnosis of erythemato-squamous diseases is a real problemin dermatology. They all share the clinical features of erythema and scaling, with very little differences. The diseases in this group are psoriasis, seboreic dermatitis, lichenplanus, pityriasis rosea, cronic dermatitis, and pityriasis rubra pilaris. Usually a biopsy isnecessary for the diagnosis but unfortunately these diseases share manyhistopathological features as well. Another difficulty for the differential diagnosis is that adisease may show the features of another disease at the beginning stage and may havethe characteristic features at the following stages. Patients were first evaluated clinicallywith 12 features. Afterwards, skin samples were taken for the evaluation of 22 histopathological features. The values of the histopathological features are determinedby an analysis of the samples under a microscope.In the dataset constructed for thisdomain, the family history feature has the value 1 if any of these diseases has beenobserved in the family, and 0 otherwise. The age feature simply represents the age ofthe patient. Every other feature (clinical and histopathological) was given a degree inthe range of 0 to 3. Here, 0 indicates that the feature was not present, 3 indicates thelargest amount possible, and 1, 2 indicate the relative intermediate values.The namesand id numbers of the patients were recently removed from the database.

## Problem Statement
* Create a predictive model using machine learning techniques to predict the various classes of skin disease.
* Prepare the data, identifying and extracting key features (both input and output parameters) relevant to the problem you will solve.
* Build and train a machine learning model. Here you can evaluate different algorithms, settings and see which model is best for your scenario.

## AIM
* Create a machine learning model to predict the various classes of skin disease.
* Suggest the Doctors to identify the skin diseases of the patient at the earliest.
